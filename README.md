# C3/C4 plant competition model

This repository contains the Python script to run the C3/C4 P model with an example input and the plotting scripts to reproduce the figures presented in:

Lavergne et al. (submitted) A semi-empirical model for primary production, isotopic discrimination and competition of C3 and C4 plants


# The script written in Python and input data are:

# Data availability

The data that support the findings of this study is publicly available. The CRU TS datasets are available from East Anglia University (UK) at https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/. The WATCH-WFDEI dataset is available from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Austria) via the WATCH FTP server at ftp://rfdata:forceDATA@ftp.iiasa.ac.at. The annual percentage treecover from MEaSURES VCF5KYR v001 is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/VCF/VCF5KYR.001. Cropland cover data from MODIS MCD12C1 v006 are available at https://lpdaac.usgs.gov/products/mcd12c1v006/. The map of fraction of C4 plants from Still et al. (2009) is available at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/932. The AVHRR GIMMS fAPAR data was made available by R. Myneni (data request contact: rmyneni@bu.edu). The concentrations and isotopic compositions of atmospheric CO2 are available in the Supplementary Material of Köhler et al. (2017) and Graven et al. (2017) papers, respectively. The soil carbon isotopic data were extracted from https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6556096 and are available in the Supplementary Material, along with the leaf carbon isotopic data from Cornwell et al. (2018), the leaf gas-exchange data for C4 plants from Lin et al. (2015) and the share of C4 plants in ecosystem GPP from Paruelo et al. (1996, 1998).
