# Data availability

The data that support the findings of this study are publicly available. The CRU TS4.03 datasets are available from East Anglia University (UK) at https://crudata.uea.ac.uk/cru/data/hrg/. The WATCH-WFDEI dataset is available from the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (Austria) via the WATCH FTP server at ftp://rfdata:forceDATA@ftp.iiasa.ac.at. The annual percentage treecover from MEaSURES VCF5KYR v001 is available at https://doi.org/10.5067/MEaSUREs/VCF/VCF5KYR.001. Urban areas and C3 and C4 crop distribution from LUHv2-2019 data are available at https://daac.ornl.gov/VEGETATION/guides/LUH2_GCB2019.html. The map of fraction of C4 plants from Still et al. (2009)20 is available at https://doi.org/10.3334/ORNLDAAC/932. The global C4 distribution map developed by Luo et al. (2024)12 is available at https://zenodo.org/records/10516423. The AVHRR GIMMS fAPAR data were made available by R. Myneni (data request contact: rmyneni@bu.edu). The concentrations and isotopic compositions of atmospheric CO2 are available in the Supplementary Material of Köhler et al. (2017)58, Graven et al. (2017)62 and Graven et al. (2020)30 papers, respectively. The soil carbon isotopic data were extracted from Dong et al. (2022)29 and is available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.6556096. The leaf carbon isotopic data are derived from Cornwell et al. (2018)28, the leaf gas-exchange data for C4 plants from Lin et al. (2015)63 and the share of C4 plants in ecosystem GPP from Paruelo et al. (1996, 1998)64,65, all available in the original papers.
